There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":29,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1752561188359,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":550,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"06a83879-00ec-4100-b12b-b565dbc65f1d","nodeType":"const"}},"chartState":{"chartModel":{"modelType":"range","chartId":"id-r39dwel336","chartType":"groupedColumn","chartThemeName":"datalabTheme","chartOptions":{"common":{"animation":{"enabled":true}}},"chartPalette":{"fills":["#6568A0","#43D7A4","#4095DB","#FACC5F","#CAE279","#F08083","#5BCDF2","#F099DC","#965858","#7DB64F","#A98954"],"strokes":["#6568A0","#43D7A4","#4095DB","#FACC5F","#CAE279","#F08083","#5BCDF2","#F099DC","#965858","#7DB64F","#A98954"],"up":{"fill":"#459d55","stroke":"#1e652e"},"down":{"fill":"#ef5452","stroke":"#a82529"},"neutral":{"fill":"#b5b5b5","stroke":"#575757"},"altUp":{"fill":"#5090dc","stroke":"#2b5c95"},"altDown":{"fill":"#ffa03a","stroke":"#cc6f10"},"altNeutral":{"fill":"#b5b5b5","stroke":"#575757"}},"cellRange":{"rowStartIndex":null,"rowStartPinned":null,"rowEndIndex":null,"rowEndPinned":null,"columns":[]},"switchCategorySeries":false,"suppressChartRanges":false,"unlinkChart":false,"version":"32.2.2"},"rangeChartModel":{"rangeColumns":[],"switchCategorySeries":false},"pivotMode":{"enabled":false}}}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"19cc6300-3213-443a-a2f7-3ada29944e06","visualizeDataframe":false,"version":"ag-charts-v1"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":60,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"school_name","type":"string"},{"name":"borough","type":"string"},{"name":"building_code","type":"string"},{"name":"average_math","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_reading","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_writing","type":"integer"},{"name":"percent_tested","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4],"school_name":["New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math High School","Essex Street Academy","Lower Manhattan Arts Academy","High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies","Henry Street School for International Studies"],"borough":["Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan"],"building_code":["M022","M445","M445","M445","M056"],"average_math":[657,395,418,613,410],"average_reading":[601,411,428,453,406],"average_writing":[601,387,415,463,381],"percent_tested":[null,78.9,65.1,95.9,59.7]}},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                                         school_name  ... percent_tested\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...  ...
